# FNF Files
This is hopefully where I'll be sharing FNF-related files like FLPs and chromatic scales.

## Folders
- [Chromatic Scales](/Chromatic%20Scales): This is where character voices are located, separated by [WAV](/Chromatic%20Scales/WAV) and [DWP](/Chromatic%20Scales/DWP) format.
- [Instrumentals and Vocals](/Instrumentals%20and%20Vocals): This is where you can download the separated tracks for charting purposes.
- [Song Projects](/Song%20Projects): Contains the FLP and FLM projects for some songs.
