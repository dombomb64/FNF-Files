# FNF Files
This is hopefully where I'll be sharing FNF-related files like FLPs and chromatic scales.

## Folders
- Chromatic Scales: This is where character voices are located, separated by WAV and DWP format.
- Instrumentals and Vocals: This is where you can download the separated tracks for charting purposes.
- Song Projects: Contains the FLP and FLM projects for some songs.
